      <h3>About Me</h3><br>
      <p>Hello, My name is Fadumo Mohamed .I am aspiring to be a full-stack developer.What can a “full-stack web developer” do, you ask?
        <br>I can conjur a website from nothing into existence, fully formed. I do not use tricks, nor is this magic. I specialize in manipulating 
        the very fabric of the web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and others .Linux servers serve me, domains are my domain, and certificates are certain.</p><br>
        <p>Taking a course in programming is fun and fruitful.So,I am sure most are asking how i find coding. Well coding is very interesting,You are always learning and challenging yourself! 
          Whether you are learning a new programming language, trying out a new framework, or trying to solve a problem with a new algorithm, you are always stretching your mind. Now don’t get me wrong, 
          the learning curve for coding is pretty steep. However by letting yourself make those mistake and experience those failures, that is when you grow the most. I’ve learned so much by overcoming 
          the challenges that come with coding. Not only does coding make you a better problem solver but it also teaches you patience, perseverance, and discipline. 
          Coding pushes you outside of your comfort zone in a good way! </p><br><br>
          <p>Other than coding , i am passionate about sewing. This hobby of mine makes it easy for me to relax in my own kind of way .</p>
